          "Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, (born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team, regarded as one of the greatest batsman of all time.[4] He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket. Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.[5] He is colloquially known as Little Master or Master Blaster,[6][7][8][9] and often referred to as the God of Cricket by Indian cricket followers.[10][11] Despite his reputation, he is known for his modesty and humility, once stating I am not the God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn’t",

Due to fitness issues, he was absent from the national scene for extended stretches but was a part of the Indian team in two Cricket World Cup campaigns, two Asia Cups and three ICC Champions Trophy. He had also been particularly effective in the Indian Premier League, in which he has represented five different teams. Nehra was called one of the best bowlers that the India national cricket team has ever seen by Ravi Shastri.[citation needed] M.S.
