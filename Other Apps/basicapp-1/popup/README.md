# popup

The application consists a button,
on click, it will open a popup having three options (yes, no and maybe).
you have to choose any one option, it will go back to the main screen and shows that
you have choosen <yes or no or maybe>


Basically, I learnt how to make dialogs(pop up window) in the app.
Concepts used in the app:
- SimpleDialog
- showDialog() method
- Future, async and await
- Navigator.push and Navigator.pop
